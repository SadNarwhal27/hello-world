A place to store ideas, resources, and discuss things

I am a student from Breckenridge, MI that is currently studying at Central Michigan University and working towards a degree in IT. 
I have a full year of Java under my belt so far but hope to keep learning this and other languages.


Project Ideas:

3D Hypotenuse Calculator - 
A small app that takes in the dimensions of a box and outputs the length between a bottom corner and the opposite top corner

Fantasy Thing Generator - 
Create random characters, spells, monsters, places, etc. to use with any form of creative writing or roll playing.

Dice Roller - 
Set the number of dice, total sides on each die, add modifiers, and generate total results for each roll.
